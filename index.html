Code me and app similar to "spaceflight simulator" but in this you add a rover which can carry waste like plastic, metal, organic waste. Make it a 2d simulator app, the rover will pick the waste from Mars surface and take it to the recycle Machine in which the plastic will be converted to 3d printer filament and metals will be melted into ingots and organic waste will be converted to fuel. Make it a mobile app.

Creating a full mobile app like "Spaceflight Simulator" with a rover and waste recycling system is a big project. However, I can help you get started with a simplified 2D simulation prototype using Unity with C#. Unity is great for mobile apps and 2D games, and you can later expand this prototype.

Key features in this prototype:
A 2D Mars surface with scattered waste items (plastic, metal, organic).
A rover that can move around and pick up waste.
A recycle machine that processes waste into products.
Basic UI to show collected waste and products.
Step 1: Setup Unity Project
Create a new 2D Unity project.
Set up a simple scene with:
A rover (a simple sprite).
Waste items scattered on the ground.
A recycle machine.
Step 2: Code Overview
RoverController.cs: Move rover and pick up waste.
WasteItem.cs: Waste type and interaction.
RecycleMachine.cs: Process waste into products.
GameManager.cs: Manage inventory and UI.

Step 4: Scene Setup
Create a Rover GameObject with a Rigidbody2D and Collider2D (set to trigger).
Create several WasteItem GameObjects with different sprites and assign their WasteType.
Create a RecycleMachine GameObject with a Collider2D (set to trigger).
Assign the rover reference in the RecycleMachine script.
Add UI elements to display inventory and products (optional for now).
Step 5: Build for Mobile
In Unity, go to File > Build Settings.
Switch platform to Android or iOS.
Configure input for mobile (touch controls) later.
Build and test on your device.
Next Steps to Improve
Add touch controls for rover movement.
Add animations and better graphics.
Add UI to show inventory and products.
Add sound effects.
Add missions or goals.
If you want, I can help you with touch controls or UI next. Would you like that?
